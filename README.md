## Introduction

Hue UI is built primarily used as a personal UI library as I felt i was often repeating myself when working on new projects. It's heavily inspired by [Mantine](https://github.com/mantinedev/mantine) and relies much on the foundations created in [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). This library is building on blocks already created by these awesome packages.

So why did i create my own? Well, I often found myself arguing with existing packages to accommodate for my desired design expression.

## Packages

- `@hue-ui/core` - core component library
- `@hue-ui/hooks` - collection of hooks for state and UI management, exports everything from @hue-ui/styles
- `@hue-ui/styles` - providers that help define different stylistic settings that's used in all components
